This project  will only work on linux or on anything that has a sort of linux proc file system.
For example, MAC doesnt have a proc file system.
FreeBSD used to have one in the past but no longer has it.
Alumos has a proc file system but is different, in alumos machines, the proc file system only contains the pids, there is no other stuff like devices, crypto, cpu, etc.
In Alumo you can still do cat /proc/self/psinfo, but it will come as binary data. And in order to read this binary data we would need to parse it in the kernel.
But in linux, where most of the proc file system data is in string, not in binary, so we can parse it directly in bash.

Some tools that this project tries to simulate:
htop
btop

/proc/stat --> Information we will used
man /proc/stat --> Says what each column is exactly. In case pf having problems doing this command you can do man proc_stat pr man 5 proc_stat.

watch -n1 head 5 /proc/stat --> Rerun every 1 second the comand head 5 /proc/stat
watch -n1 -d head 5 /proc/stat --> Does the same as before but highlights the diferences

To know the value we will store the value of the data, store it, and then after 1 second get new data,
after that we will calculate the diference, once we have the difference over a 1 second time scale, then 
we know the utilization in that last second. If our cpu was on 50% of the time and off 50% of the time, 
thats 50% CPU utilization.
