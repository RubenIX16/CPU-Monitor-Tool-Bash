This project  will only work on linux or on anything that has a sort of linux proc file system.
For example, MAC doesnt have a proc file system.
FreeBSD used to have one in the past but no longer has it.
Alumos has a proc file system but is different, in alumos machines, the proc file system only contains the pids, there is no other stuff like devices, crypto, cpu, etc.
In Alumo you can still do cat /proc/self/psinfo, but it will come as binary data. And in order to read this binary data we would need to parse it in the kernel.
But in linux, where most of the proc file system data is in string, not in binary, so we can parse it directly in bash.

Some tools that this project tries to simulate:
htop
btop
